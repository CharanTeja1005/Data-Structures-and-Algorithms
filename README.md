    vii. Set(index,x)

    viii. Max()

    ix.  Min()

    x. Sum()

    xi. Avg()

    xii. Reverse() (in 2 ways)

    xiii. Inserting in a Sorted Array

    xiv. isSorted()

    xv.  Rearrangement() (brings -ve elements to left side and +ve to right)

    xvi. Merge two arrays

    xvii. Set Operations

            a. Union

            b. Intersection
